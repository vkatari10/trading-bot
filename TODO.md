# TODO

# High Priority 
- [ ] `src/runtime; src/ml` Add more technical indicators and deltas for more useful features, update associated Python ang Go methods
- [ ] Develop Internal API to expose runtime engine actions as its own API

## Long Term Improvements <!--===========================================-->

### ML
- [ ] Potentially allow user to decide which ML model to use (JSONs)

### Trading Logic
- [ ] Heighten buy, sell strictness (one indicator should not dictate a buy/sell action). Also include a way to determine the sensitivity of a signal to increase and decrease the ordering amount of shares accordingly.

### API

- [ ] Figure out how use websockets and gRPC to improve ML <-> Go communication
